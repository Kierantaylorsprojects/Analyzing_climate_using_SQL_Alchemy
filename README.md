# Analyzing_climate_using_SQL_Alchemy

In this project I analyzed and explored the Climate Data. 

More Specifically, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

I then designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed and returned the JSON representation of my dictionary, stations, temperature observations for the previous year, minimum temp., average temp, and max temp. for a specified range.
